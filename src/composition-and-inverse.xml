        <p>The composition of functions is really about making one function the input for another. Here is a medical example of the composition of two functions. Let <m>f(t)</m> be a function that relates the amount of drug, <m>D</m> in <quantity><unit prefix="milli" base="gram" /></quantity>, in a patient's bloodstream as a function of time, <m>t</m> in hours. At time goes on, the amount of drug in the paritent's body decreases as the body eliminates it.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, the drug is meant to help slow the heart rate of a patient, so as the drug leaves the patient's bloodstream, the heart rate increases. Therefore, the heart rate <m>H</m>, in beats per minute, is a function of <m>D</m>, the amount of drug in the body. We can write <m>H = g(D)</m> where <m>g</m> is a function relating the Heart rate to the amount of drug in the body.</p>

        <p>Therefore we have two functions: the heart rate is a function of the amount of drug in the bloodstream and the amount of drug is a function of time. Utimately, the heart rate is a function of time.</p>

        <p>Using function notation the composition of these two functions looks like this:<me>H=g(D)\text{ and }D=f(t)\text{ so that }H=g(f(t))\text{.}</me> If each function had a formula then we would literally put one formula into the other.</p>
