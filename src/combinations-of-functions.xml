      <title>Gist of Combinations of Functions</title>
      <p>In this lesson, we learned to <term>combine</term> functions graphically, numerically, and with formulas. However, you most likely have been combining functions at some level your whole life.</p>
      <p>Combining functions means to perform arithmetic operations on the outputs of two or more functions, such as:</p>
      <dl>
        <title></title>
        <li>
          <title><m>f(x) + g(x)</m></title>
          <p>The ouputs of two functions are added together.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><m>\frac{\displaystyle{f(x)}}{\displaystyle{g(x)}}</m></title>
          <p>The ouputs of two functions are divided.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><m>f(x)^{\displaystyle{g(x)}}</m></title>
          <p>The output of one function is used as the exponent on the output of the other function.</p>
        </li>
      </dl>

      <p>Note that this is different from the <term>composition</term> of functions from <xref ref="chapter-composition-and-inverse">chapter</xref>, where the output of one function was used as the input of another function.</p>
      <p>Typical combinations in this course are adding/subtracting and multiplying/dividing functions, though any operation on two or more numbers would correspond to a function combination.</p>
      <p>A simple example of the combination of functions is that of <em>Profit</em>, <em>Revenue</em> and <em>Cost</em>.</p>

      <example>
        <p>It costs money to manufacture a product, and you can make money by selling it. The <em>profit</em> is the difference between how much money you collect from selling the product, and how much it cost to manufacture it.</p>
        <p>Let <m>C(u)</m> be the cost, in thousands of dollars, of manufacturing <m>u</m> tons of a product. Let <m>R(u)</m> be the revenue, in thousands of dollars, collected through selling <m>u</m> tons of the product. Finally, <m>P(u)</m> is the profit, in thousands of dollars, from making and selling <m>u</m> tons of the product.</p>
        <p>Using function notation, we would write:<md><mrow>P(u) = R(u) - C(u)</mrow></md></p>

        <p>As a business owner, you know the value in giving your customers a good deal, especially when they buy a lot from you.</p>
        <p>This month at your pet supply store, you decide to run the following special on your most popular item, <em>My Little Deuce Scoop</em>, a cat box shovel shaped like a 1932 Ford hotrod:</p>
        <p>The retail price for the item is $24, but if a customer orders two of them, you will reduce the unit price by $0.25, so they would each cost only $23.75.</p>
        <p>If a customer orderes three items, the unit cost would be reduced another $0.25, so they would each cost only $23.50</p>
        <p>Thus, as the number of items increases, the cost of each one will decrease.</p>

              <p>The total cost function, <m>T(x)</m>, may be thought of as a combination of two different functions, <m>C(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m>.</p>
              <p>We already determined the unit cost function, <m>C(x)</m>, in the last problem. Restate it below:</p>
              <p><m>C(x) = </m><var name="$unitCost" width="15" /></p>
              <p>The other function is a simple, but important part of the total cost.</p>
              <p>If we want to charge someone for a purchase, we need the unit cost and the quantity being purchased. Let our second function be the quantity, <m>Q(x)</m>, of items being purchased.</p>
              <p>What is the quantity being purchased in general? This is easier than you think.</p>
              <p>Answer:  <m>Q(x) = </m><var name="$sold" width="15" /></p>
              <p>Finally, we combine these to make the total cost function, <m>T(x)</m>:</p>
              <p><m>T(x) = C(x)*Q(x) = </m><var name="$totalCost" width="15" /></p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
              <p>The function <m>Q(x)</m> is supposed to find the quantity being purchased. However, you should remember that the input for the function, <m>x</m>, is also the quantity being purchased.</p>
              <p>So, the input and output for the function are both equal.</p>
