  <title>Introducing the number e, Continous Compounding Activity</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>A car travels from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA (about <m>170</m> miles) in the span of <m>3</m> hours.  This is an average speed of <m>170/3 \approx 56.7</m> miles per hour. </p> 

    <p>We can use this information to write equations for the distance, D miles, from Portland as functions of time, t hours, in two different ways:</p>
    <p><m>D = 170/3 * t</m> or <m>D = 56.7*t</m></p>
    <p>Some may argue these are the same formula. But are they?</p>
    <p>The first equation states <m>170</m> miles were covered in the span of <m>3</m> hours.  This is something that actually happened. It’s in the data.</p>
    <p>The second equation states <m>56.7</m> miles were covered in <m>1</m> hour. We don’t know if this actually happened, it’s just an average rate of change.</p>
    <p>Both equations will essentially give us the same results, but each one tells a different story.</p>
    <p>In the activity Introduction to Exponential Functions we learned to calculate the per unit growth factor using an overall percent change between two values.</p>
    <example>
      <p>A <m>20 \%</m>increase in the span of <m>5</m> years means
      <md>
        <mrow>b^{5} \amp= 1.2</mrow>
        <mrow>b \amp= 1.2^{1/5}</mrow>
        <mrow>b \amp= 1.0371</mrow>
      </md>
      which represents approximately a <m>3.71 \%</m> increase per year.</p>
    </example>
    <p>There is a difference between what was observed and what was calculated or predicted.  In this example, there really was a <m>20 \%</m> increase and it really took <m>5</m> years.  We calculated a <m>3.71 \%</m> annual increase, which is an average percent growth.</p>
    <p>In this activity we will first explore the meaning of exponential notation and how it can help us tell the stories of our observations. We later expand on our new knowledge to build a new form of the exponential function called the <q>continuous</q> model.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Interpreting the Exponential Form</title>
    <p>Earlier we learned that exponents <q>count</q> how many times the growth factor is repeated.</p>
    <example>
      <p>The expression <me>296(1.013)^{5}</me> states that an initial amount of <m>296</m> is increased by <m>1.3 \%</m> compounded <m>5</m> times.</p>
    </example>
      <exercise>
        <introduction>
          <p>The role of the fractional exponent is to <q>count</q> how many times the growth factor is repeated.</p>

              <p>Consider the expression <me>296(1.013)^{\frac{t}{10}}</me> with <m>t</m> counting time in years. What value of <m>t</m> would indicate the growth factor <m>b=1.013</m> is compounded <m>5</m> times?</p>
              <p>It would take <m>t=</m> <var name="50" width="4" /> years in order to get just <m>5</m> increases of the growth factor.</p>

                    <p>We know the exponent counts how many times the growth factor is repeated. We also know the growth factor tells us the percent increase or decrease.</p>

          <p>Where <m>V(t)</m> is the value of the investment in dollars and <m>t</m> is the number of years since the investment was made. The growth factor <m>1.0401</m> represents a percent increase on the investment which is sometimes called the <q>interest</q> or <q>return</q> on the investment.</p>

                <p>In one year <m>t=1</m> what is the value of the exponent? The exponent is <var name="12" width="3" /> after one year.</p>

              <li>
                <p>So, for each year that goes by, how often is the interest compounded?</p>

              <li>
                <p>What is the difference in meaning between these two formulas that calculate the value of an investment?</p>

                <p>Formula <m>2</m>: <m>4280(1.0401)^{\frac{t}{12}}</m></p>
                <p><m>4280(1.0401)^{12t}</m> means <var name="$times1" form="popup" /></p>
                <p><m>4280(1.0401)^{\frac{t}{12}}</m>means <var name="$times2" form="popup" /></p>

      <conclusion>
        <p>Compounding interest <m>12</m> times each year is the same as compounding the interest every <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year. It is referred to as <q>compounded monthly</q> because <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year is <m>1</m> month.</p>
        <p>Therefore another way to write the same equation would be</p>
        <p><m>V(t) = 4280(1.0401)^{\frac{t}{1/12}}</m></p>
        <p>Which means the interest is calculated every <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year, but no one would do this because it is silly looking.</p>
        <p>Instead we keep the exponent as <m>12t</m> which is the same as monthly and the equation is prettier.</p>
