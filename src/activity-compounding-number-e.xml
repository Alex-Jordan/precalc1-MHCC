    <title>Review of Discrete Compouding</title>
    <p>Earlier we learned that exponents <q>count</q> how many times the growth factor is repeated. The expression <me>296(1.013)^{5}</me> is stating an initial amount of <m>296</m> increased by <m>1.3 \%</m> compounded <m>5</m> times.</p>
    <p>The exponent <m>5</m> means the <m>1.3 \%</m> increase happens <m>5</m> times in a row.</p>
    <example>
      <p>Consider the expression <me>296(1.013)^{\frac{t}{10}}</me> with <m>t</m> counting time in years. What would <m>t</m> have to be so the exponent counts <m>5</m> increases of <m>1.3 \%</m>?</p>

            <p>Which means the interest is calculated every <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year, but no one would do this because it is silly looking.</p>
            <p>Instead we say the interest is compounded <m>12</m> times a year which is the same as monthly and the equation is prettier.</p>
