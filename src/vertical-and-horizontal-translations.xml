        <title>Purpose</title>
        <p>In this activity, we will explore how to <term>transform</term> the graph of a function by making changes to its formula. By the end of this activity, you will be able to</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Write the formula for a basic function which has been transformed.</p></li>
          <li><p>Sketch the graph of a basic function which has been transformed.</p></li>

        <p>You should now see how a function's graph is transformed by changing its formula in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><m>y = f(x) + k</m></li>
          <li><m>y = f(x + h)</m></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now put that to the test to determine the equation of a basic function which has been transformed.</p>
