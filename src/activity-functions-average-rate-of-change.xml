    <title>Average Rate of Change</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>In this activity we introduce the math symbol <m>\Delta</m> that represents change and we develop the concept of <em>average rate of change</em></p>
		<p>It will be helpful to remember that the speed of an object is defined as the distance the object travels divided by the time it takes to travel that distance.</p>
		<p>After completing this lesson you will be able to:
            <ul>
                <li><p>Perform calculations using function notation including Average Rate of Change.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to calculate the slope of a line and understanding the meaning of slope.</p>
