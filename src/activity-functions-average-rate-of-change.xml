        <introduction>
            <p>After completing this lesson you will be able to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Perform calculations using function notation including Average Rate of Change.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Define an interval and understand the use of inequality notation to denote an interval.</p>

    <introduction>
        <p>In this activity we introduce the math symbol <m>\Delta</m> that represents change and we develop the concept of <term>average rate of change</term>.</p>

        <p>It will be helpful to remember that the speed of an object is defined as the distance the object travels divided by the time it takes to travel that distance.</p>

        <p>The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to calculate the slope of a line and understanding the meaning of slope.</p>

        <p>Let's start by realizing you already understand the concept of <em>average rate of change</em> but maybe you have never hear the phrase before.</p>

        <p>It turns out that <term>average rate of change</term> is just another way to talk about slope.</p>

A positive change means the train travels away from downtown and a negative change means the train travels towards downtown.</p>

        <title>Computing Average Rate of Change</title>

        <p>As we move from one point to another point on a function, there are two changes that take place. The input will change, call it <m>\Delta\text{Input}</m> and the output will change, call it <m>\Delta\text{Output}</m>.</p>

        <p>If we divide the two changes we get an <term>average rate of change</term>.</p>

        <p>An average rate of change <m>=\frac{\Delta Output}{\Delta Input}</m>.</p>

        <p>Does this look familiar?  Think <q>rise over run</q>.  Once again, average rate of change is just slope.</p>

        <todo>Create the graph of a funciton f(x) = (x-2)(x+3). User places points on the graph at (-4,f(-4)), (-1, f(-1)) and (2, f(2)) these need to be correctly placed.  Then student has to find equations of lines that pass through the first two ordered pairs and through the last two ordered pairs. Somehow need to keep track of the points they plotted on the graph.</todo>

            </webwork>
        </exercise>

        <p>As demonstrated in the previous exercise, the average rate of change of a function depends on what interval (section) of the input axis we use.</p>

        <p>As a practical example, consider the hourly salary for a worker at a manufacturing plant who works during the day versus someone who works at night.</p>

        <p>If the day worker works from 8 <init>a.m.</init> to 4 <init>p.m.</init> and earns <m>\$168</m> then over a span of <m>8</m> hours the worker has earned an <em>average rate</em> of <m>\frac{168}{8} = 21 \frac{\$}{\text{hour}}</m>. But this is on the interval 8 <init>a.m.</init> <m>\leq</m> time <m>\leq</m> 4 p.m.</p>

        <p>However, if the night worker works the same number of hours from 4 <init>p.m.</init> <m>\leq</m> time <m>\leq</m> 12 <init>a.m.</init> (from 4 <init>p.m.</init> to 12 a.m.) and earns <m>\$200</m>, then over an <m>8</m> hour span that worker has earned an <em>average rate</em> of <m>\frac{200}{8} = 25 \frac{\$}{\text{hour}}</m>.</p>

        <p>We see that the average rate is greater during a night interval of time versus a day interval because night workers get paid more at this plant. In each case the average rate of pay, or just average rate, is the total change in money earned (<m>\Delta\text{output}</m>) divided the total change in hours worked (<m>\Delta\text{input}</m>).</p>

        <p>To find an average rate of change, two outputs need to be calculated and the results are subtracted.  Then that value is divided by the differce between the two input values.</p>

                            <p>To answer this question recall earlier you calculated <m>f(0)</m> and <m>f(-2)</m>. Use these values to make the following calculations:</p>
                            <p><m>\frac{f(0) - f(2)}{0 - 2} = </m> <var name="$aveRate1" width="5" /></p>

                            <p>The only thing that matters is that the ordered pairs are kept together.  In this example the ordered pairs are <m>(0, f(0))</m> and <m>(2,f(2))</m>. If you choose to start with <m>x = 0</m> in the denominator then you must start with <m>f(0)</m> in the numerator.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, if you choose to start with <m>x = 2</m> in the denominator then you must start with <m>f(2)</m> in the numerator. We say that the ordered pairs <em>must be vertically aligned</em>.</p>

        <p>Let's finish this activity by going back to the train example where the distance (miles) of the train from downtown is a function of the time (hours) after 8 a.m.  In other words <m>D = f(t)</m>.</p>
