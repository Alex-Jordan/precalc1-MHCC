Current technology in education software is used mostly in the assessment of homework. On the other hand, reading material in the form of an e-book is relatively static; it is an electronic version of the text that remains a passive reading experience for the student.

 

The result is students often skip the reading altogether and go directly to the homework section where they hope to learn their skills through repetition or by “reverse engineering” of the solutions.

While homework remains a key aspect in student learning, it is currently used at the “back end” of the learning process. Research shows that an active, discovery-based approach in knowledge development, the “front end” of learning, contributes to longer knowledge retention and is linked to a deeper understanding of the material.

 

This book is a collection of activities, a digital workbook, that replaces traditional textbook reading with an interactive, guided-lesson approach to learning. The workbook covers common topics of precalculus that are otherwise delivered as passive reading assignments or lectures.
