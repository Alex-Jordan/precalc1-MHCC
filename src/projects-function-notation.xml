            Arizona Cardinals running back LaRod Stephens-Howling once returned a kick-off to make a 102-yard touchdown against the Oakland Raiders. The ball was kicked from the 30-yard line, and it was caught 2 yards into the end zone. Watching the YouTube video of the kick-off, I approximated the angle at which the ball was kicked and, with the help of the internet and an old physics book, I determined the path of the ball could be modeled using the formula <me>f(x)=\frac{-1}{256}x^2+\frac{216}{256}x</me> where x is the horizontal distance of the ball (measured in feet) away from where the ball was kicked, and <m>f(x)</m> is its height above the ground (measured in feet).
