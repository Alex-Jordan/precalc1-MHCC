        <p>A <term>Power Function</term> is a single-term function of the form <me>y = ax^k</me> where <m>a</m> and <m>k</m> are constant numbers.</p>
        <p>For us, the important characteristic of a <term>power function</term> is the shape of its graph, and in particular, the tendency of the graph as <m>x</m> gets very far from zero.</p>
        <p>This tendency is referred to as the <term>end-behavior</term> of the function.</p>
        <p><term>Power functions</term> of the form <me>y = x^k</me> when <m>k</m> is an even number <m>(2, 4, 6, \cdots)</m>, all resemble <m>x^2</m>, in the sense that their output values constantly increase as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m> or <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>.</p>
        <p>We would say that power functions with even exponents all have similar <term>end-behavior</term> &#8212; the graph keeps increasing forever when <m>x</m> gets far from zero.</p>

      <subsection>
        <title>Summary of Polynomials</title>

        <p><term>Polynomials</term> are functions of the form: <me>y = a_nx^n + a_{n−1}x^{n−1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0</me>
        where the numbers <m>a_0, a_1, \cdots, a_{n-1}, a_n</m> are some constant real numbers, called <term>coefficients</term>.</p>
        <p>Note that some of the coefficients may be zero.</p>
        <remark>
          <p>It is common to write an arbitrary list of values like <me>a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n</me> when we don't know (or don't want to specify) how many there are in the list. The subscript <m>n</m> just means that the list is not infinitely long.</p>
        </remark>
        <p>Here are some examples of polynomials you already know:
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{The line } y = 3x - 7</mrow>
          <mrow>\text{The parabola } y = x^2 + 1</mrow>
        </md></p>
        <p>The <term>degree</term> of a polynomial is the value of highest exponent in the formula.</p>
        <p>So our parabola <me>y = x^2 + 1</me> has <term>degree</term> <m>2</m> and our line <me>y = 3x − 7</me> has <term>degree</term> <m>1</m>.</p>
        <p>The exponents of a polynomial can only be non-negative integers. That means functions like
          <me>y = x^\frac{1}{2}</me>
          and
          <me>y = 2x^3 - x^{-5}</me>
        are <em>not</em> polynomials.</p>

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>Which of the functions below are polynomials?</p>
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x) \amp= x^5 - \frac{2}{x}</mrow>
              <mrow>g(x) \amp= 2 + 6x^3</mrow>
              <mrow>h(x) \amp= \frac{11x^3+4x}{9\pi}</mrow>
              <mrow>p(x) \amp= 5\sqrt{x}+9</mrow>
              <mrow>q(x) \amp= (6x-2)(5x^3-2x+7)</mrow>
              <mrow>r(x) \amp= \log_7(4)x(x+\sqrt{12.8})</mrow>
            </md>
          </statement>
          <hint><p>You may do some algebra to simplify a function before deciding if it is a polynomial.</p></hint>
          <answer><p>The functions <m>f(x)</m> and <m>p(x)</m> are <em>not</em> polynomials, but the others <em>are</em>.</p>
          <p>The <term>coefficients</term> may be complicated, as when simplifying <m>r(x)</m>: <me>r(x)= \log_7(4)x^2 + \log_7(4)\sqrt{12.8}x</me></p>
          </answer>
        </exercise>

        <p>The <term>coefficients</term> can be positive, negative or zero. In the <m>4^{\rm{th}}</m> degree polynomial
        <md>
          <mrow>y \amp= −5x^4+2x^3−x^1+0.69x^0</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= -5x^4 + 2x^3 - x + 0.69</mrow>
        </md>
          the coefficient of <m>x^3</m> is <m>2</m>, and the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is <m>0</m> (because there <em>is</em> no <m>x^2</m> term).</p>
        <p>The term with the highest power of <m>x</m> is called the <term>leading term</term>. In the polynomial above, the leading term is <m>-5x^4</m>.</p>

        <p>When polynomials are multiplied together, the result will also a polynomial, and the degree of this new polynomial is just the sum of the degrees of the formulas you multiplied together.</p>
        <example>
          <p>The two linear (<m>1^{\rm{st}}</m> degree) polynomials
            <me>7x + 2</me>
            and
            <me>5x + 4</me>
            will create a <m>2^{\rm{nd}}</m> degree polynomial when multiplied together:</p>
            <p><me>(7x + 2)(5x + 4) = 35x^2 + 38x + 8</me></p>
            <p>Recall from <xref ref="chapter-combinations-of-functions">chapter</xref>, that if we named the linear functions <m>f(x) = 7x + 2</m> and <m>g(x) = 5x + 4</m>, then the <m>2^{\rm{nd}}</m> degree polynomial <m>35x^2 + 38x + 8</m> above may be thought of as the function combination:  <m>f(x)\cdot g(x)</m></p>
        </example>



        <p>An input value which gives an output of zero is called a <term>root</term> of the polynomial, and a <term>root</term> corresponds to an <m>x</m>-intercept of the polynomial's graph.</p>
        <example xml:id="example-cubic-polynomial-roots">
          <p>The values <md>
          <mrow>x \amp= 3</mrow>
          <mrow>x \amp= \frac{1}{2}</mrow>
          <mrow>x \amp= -4</mrow></md>
          are all roots of the polynomial: <me>f(x) = 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 100x + 48</me></p>
          <p>To confirm this, we could either:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>Evaluate <m>f\left(3\right)</m>, <m>f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> and <m>f(-4)</m>, and see that they each give zero as the output. (Try this!)</p></li>
              <li><p>Graph the function <m>y = f(x)</m> and observe that it contains the <m>x</m>-intercepts <m>(3, 0)</m>, <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)</m> and <m>(-4, 0)</m>.</p>

        <paragraphs><title>Finding the Formula for a Polynomial</title>
        <p>If you know the roots of a polynomial, you can easily create a list of linear factors (lines of degree 1) which have those same roots. Then, multiplying those linear factors together will create a polynomial which has all of those roots.</p>
        <example>
          <p>In <xref ref="example-cubic-polynomial-roots">Example</xref>, we were told that the polynomial had the roots <m>3</m>, <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>-4</m>.</p>
          <p>If we wanted to write the formula for <m>f(x)</m>, using only this information, we could create the linear factors: <md>
            <mrow>\left(x - 3\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>(x - \frac{1}{2})</mrow>
            <mrow>\left(x + 4\right)</mrow></md></p>
          <p>Multiplying these factors together <me>\left(x-3\right)(x-\frac{1}{2})\left(x+4\right)</me> gives a polynomial which has all three of those roots.</p>
          <p>Note: This polynomial is <em>not</em> the same as <m>f(x)</m> from <xref ref="example-cubic-polynomial-roots">Example</xref>, though it does have the same roots.</p>
        </example>

        <p>Now, beyond just making a polynomial have particular roots, you can also vertically stretch or compress your function in order to adjust the shape, making it pass through any other point you may know on the polynomial.</p>

        <example>
          <p>Suppose we know that a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> has the roots
          <md>
            <mrow>x \amp= 5</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp= -6</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp= 9</mrow>
          </md>
          and that it also contains the point <m>(4,2)</m>.</p>
          <p>We can determine a polynomial which has these characteristics by creating linear factors which have the given roots:
          <md>
            <mrow>x = 5 \amp\implies (x - 5)</mrow>
            <mrow>x = -6 \amp\implies (x + 6)</mrow>
            <mrow>x = 9 \amp\implies (x - 9)</mrow>
          </md></p>
          <p>Multiplying these factors together will make a polynomial which has the given roots: <me>y = (x-5)(x+6)(x-9)</me>
          However, it does <em>not</em> pass through the point <m>(4, 2)</m>, because using the input <m>x = 4</m> gives:
          <md>
            <mrow>y \amp= (4-5)(4+6)(4-9)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= (-1)(10)(-5)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= 50</mrow>
          </md></p>
          <p>In order to make our polynomial also pass through the point <m>(4,2)</m>, we will use a vertical compression. We know this must be a compression, because our function currently has an output of <m>50</m> when the input is <m>4</m> &#8212; we want the output to be only <m>2</m>.</p>
          <p>For the vertical compression, we include a constant factor <m>k</m> to our function: <me>y = k(x-5)(x+6)(x-9)</me></p>
          <p>Notice that multiplying by a constant <m>k</m> does not change the roots of the function.</p>
          <p>In order to determine the value of <m>k</m> that will work here, we use the point <m>(4,2)</m>, substituting <m>4</m> for <m>x</m>, and <m>2</m> for <m>y</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>2 \amp= k(4-5)(4+6)(4-9)</mrow>
            <mrow>2 \amp= k(50)</mrow>
            <mrow>k \amp= \frac{2}{50}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=0.04</mrow>
          </md></p>
          <p>Therefore, we have a polynomial which passes through <m>(4,2)</m> and has the correct roots:<me>y = 0.04(x-5)(x+6)(x-9)</me></p>
          <remark>
            <p>This is not the only polynomial that fits these conditions. Why?</p>

        <paragraphs><title>Repeated Roots</title>
        <p>Linear factors may be repeated, as in: <md>
          <mrow>y \amp= (x-3)^2</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= (x-3)(x-3)</mrow></md>

        <p>Since a linear factor <m>(x-a)</m> corresponds to a root <m>x = a</m>, then repeating a linear factor will give us a <term>repeated root</term>.</p>
        <p>If a root is repeated <m>k</m> times, then we say that root has <term>multiplicity</term> <m>k</m>.</p>
        <example>
          <p>The polynomial <me>y = x^3(x-5)^2</me> has only two roots:  <m>x = 0</m> and <m>x = 5</m></p>
          <p>We say the root <m>x = 0</m> has <term>multiplicity</term> <m>3</m>, and the root <m>x = 5</m> has <term>multiplicity</term> <m>2</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <p>How does a <term>repeated root</term> affect the graph? We know that a root will appear as an <m>x</m>-intercept on the graph, but will repeating a root in a formula mean the <m>x</m>-intercept is somehow also repeated?</p>
        <p>In <xref ref="chapter-vertical-and-horizontal-translations">Chapter</xref>, we learned to shift a parabola <em>left</em> or <em>right</em>, just by adding a number to the input. For example:
          <me>y = (x+3)^2 \text{ is the parabola }x^2\text{, moved to the left by }3 \text{ units}</me>
        </p>
        <p>This parabola has just one root which has been repeated twice, and the graph appears to <em>bounce</em> off of the <m>x</m>-axis at the root.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon of <em>bouncing</em> remains a characteristic of the graph, even if we give a polynomial more linear factors, such as: <me>y = (x+3)^2(x-1)</me></p>

        <p>You probably noticed that while an even <term>multiplicity</term> of a root causes the graph to bounce off of the <m>x</m>-axis, sometimes the graph is below the <m>x</m>-axis and sometimes it is above the <m>x</m>-axis.</p>
        <p>What causes this? How can we predict whether the graph will be above the <m>x</m>-axis or below it?</p>
        <p>The reason for this has to do with the <term>end-behavior</term> of the whole function. That is, the graph of a polynomial will eventually either increase or decrease forever as <m>x</m> gets far from zero.</p>
        <p>Since the <term>end-behavior</term> of a function is the tendency of the graph as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m> or <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>, we may ask how to determine this without having to graph the function.</p>

        <example>
          <p>A table of values for the function <m>f(x) = x^3 - 45x^2 + 12x - 20</m> is shown below.</p>

          <p>The function initially was decreasing very quickly, but eventually began to increase (even faster). In fact, this function will eventually increase <em>forever</em> as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>.</p>
          <p>We can make sense of this by considering the formula for <m>f(x)</m> and imagining substituting a very large value of <m>x</m>.</p>
          <p>If <m>x</m> was large, say <m>1,000,000</m>, evaluating the function would look like:<md>
            <mrow>f(1,000,000) \amp= (1,000,000)^3 - 45(1,000,000)^2 + 12(1,000,000) - 20</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \text{ENORMOUS NUMBER} - \text{ HUGE Number } + \text{ Fairly Big Number } - \text{ small number }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \text{Still an ENORMOUS NUMBER}</mrow></md></p>
          <p>(In fact, it is <m>999,955,000,011,999,980</m>.)</p>

          <p>The point is that raising a large value to the power of <m>3</m> is much more significant than raising it to the power of <m>2</m> (or any smaller power). As another piece of math terminology, we would say that the term <m>x^3</m> <term>dominates</term> the other terms. The highest power of <m>x</m> is most significant in the end, so we can just focus our attention on the <term>leading term</term> of a polynomial to determine the <term>end-behavior</term>.</p>
          <p>Written more succinctly: <blockquote>A polynomial has the same <term>end-behavior</term> as its leading term.</blockquote></p>
          <p>Similarly, we can ask what the graph tends to do as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>. This will be the same as the leading term <m>x^3</m>, which eventually decreases forever as <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>.</p>

        <exercise>
          <p>Make a rough sketch of the graph of the polynomial <m>f(x) = (x-4)(x-1)^2(x+3)^2(x+5)</m>.</p>
          <p>We must use what we know about the <term>roots</term> and their <term>multiplicities</term>, and also the <term>end-behavior</term> of the function.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>First, add the <m>x</m>-intercepts to your graph. Remember that these are determined by finding the <term>roots</term> of the function.</p></li>
            <li><p>Next, consider the <term>end-behavior</term> of the polynomial. Do this by deciding what the <term>leading term</term> would be if it was completely expanded. On the far left and far right side of the graph, draw arrows to show what the graph will eventually do (increasing or decreasing).</p></li>
            <li><p>Finally, use what you know about the <term>multiplicity</term> of each <term>root</term>. From your arrow on the far left side of the graph, draw a smooth curve which contains all of the <m>x</m>-intercepts you drew in the first step. When you get to an <m>x</m>-intercept, if its <term>multiplicity</term> is <em>odd</em>, the graph will cross over the <m>x</m>-axis, and if the <term>multiplicity</term> is <em>even</em>, the graph will bounce off of the <m>x</m>-axis.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Check the graph. If drawn correctly, you should have been able to draw from your arrow on the left side to the arrow on the right side without picking up your pencil.</p>
