        <title>A Tool for Solving Exponential Equations</title>
        <p>Logarithms are functions that, among other things, can be used to solve exponential equations. If we have an exponential equation in which the variable is in the exponent, we use logarithms to isolate the variable.</p>
        <p>By definition, a logarithm is an exponent.</p>
        <assemblage>
          <p>In the exponential equation <me>b^{y}=x</me> The exponent <q>y</q> is the logarithm so <me>y=log_{b}(x)</me></p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>There are at least three useful rules about logarithms:</p>
        <assemblage>
          <p>
            <ol label="1">
              <li>
                  <p>This first rule is often used to <q>bring the exponent down</q> <mdash /> after applying the logarithm, the exponent becomes a factor.</p>
                <p><m>\log_{b}(N^{x})=x \log_{b}(N)</m></p>
                <p>The next two rules are sometimes used to combine two terms involving logarithms, or to split one term into two.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><m>\log_{b}(AB)=\log_{b}(A)+\log_{b}(B)</m></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\log_{b}\mathopen{}\left(\frac{A}{B}\right)\mathclose{}=\log_{b}(A)-\log_{b}(B)</m>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>The first rule is definitely the most useful. I used to have a pocket knife with <m>10</m> different tools folded into it, but I only used one. Rule <m>1</m> is that tool. It allows us to take an exponential expression and <q>bring down the exponent</q> so we can isolate it.</p>
        <p>If we end up with an equation that looks like <me>(0.337)^{\text{?}}=1.272</me> as in, <q>I wonder what the exponent is?</q>, we can use a logarithmic function to find the answer.</p>
        <p>Although most likely a variable is used instead of a question mark like <me>(0.337)^{x}=1.272</me> where <m>x</m> is the unknown value we are trying to find.</p>
        <p>Using rule <m>\# 1</m> and applying any logarithm to both sides of the equation we can work our way towards isolating the unknown variable <m>x</m>.</p>
        <example>
          <title>Use rule <m>\# 1</m> to isolate and solve for the unknown variable</title>
          <statement>
          <p>
            <md>
              <mrow>(0.337)^{x}=1.272</mrow>
              <mrow>\log(0.337)^{x}= \log(1.272)</mrow>
              <mrow>x \log(0.337)= \log(1.272)</mrow>
              <mrow>x=\frac{\log(1.272)}{\log(0.337)}</mrow>
              <mrow>x \approx -0.2212</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>In this case we used <m>\log</m>, but we get the same answer using the natural logarithm, <m>\ln</m>, instead. Try it!</p>
          <p>It does not matter what base logarithm you use, as long as you use the same <m>\log_{b}</m> on both sides of the equation. However, it does help to use a function that is readily available on most calculators like base <m>10</m> (<m>\log</m>), or base <m>e</m> (<m>\ln</m>).</p>
         </statement>
        </example>
        <p>Now you try it. Solve an exponential equation using rule <m>\# 1</m>.</p>
        <exercise>
          <introduction>
            <p>How many <m>7 \%</m> increases is the same as one <m>49 \%</m> increase?</p>
          </introduction>
            <webwork>
            <stage>
              <statement>
                <p>The growth factor associated with a <m>7 \%</m> increase is <m>b=</m><var name="1.07" width="5" /></p>
              </statement>
            </stage>
            <stage>
              <statement>
                <p>The equation below literally states, <q>An unknown number of growth factors <m>b=1.07</m> is the same as <m>1.49</m></q></p>
                <p><m>(1.07)^{x}=1.49</m></p>
                <p>Apply your favorite logarithm to each side of the equation. My favorite is <m>\ln</m>, so the equation is now <me>\ln(1.07)^{x}= \ln(1.49)</me></p>
                <p>Invoke rule <m>\# 1</m> so that the exponent can come down in front of the expression on the left <me>x \ln(1.07)= \ln(1.49)</me></p>
                <p>Last step, isolate the variable by dividing both sides by <m>\ln(1.07)</m>, and what do you get?</p>
                <p><m>x=</m> <var name="5.894" width="5" /> <em>(round to <m>3</m> decimal places)</em></p>
              </statement>
            </stage>
          </webwork>
        </exercise>
        <p>Rule <m>\# 1</m> is great, but if we want to use it as the main tool we have to know when it applies and how to deal with the situation if the rule does not apply.</p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <blockquote>
            <p>
              Solve the equation for <m>x</m> <me>3(2.83)^{x}=15</me>
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>At first glance it seems you can apply rule <m>\# 1</m>, but is that right?  Rule <m>\# 1</m> states <me>\log_{b}(N^{x})=x \log_{b}(N)</me></p>
            <p>Notice how rule <m>\# 1</m> assumes you have one side written as <m>N^{x}</m> with nothing else in front (no coefficient)? The left side of our equation has a coefficient of <m>3</m> in front of the exponential<me>3(2.83)^{x}</me> The constant <m>3</m> is keeping us from using rule <m>\# 1</m>. That constant either has to be moved or we have to use another rule (if there is one that applies).</p>
            <p>We can fix the situation by rearranging the equation to match the format of rule <m>\# 1</m> or we could use rule <m>\# 2</m> because at least it matches the format of our equation.</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p><term><em>Rule <m>\# 1</m>:</em></term> <m>\log_{b}(N^{x})=x \log_{b}(N)</m></p>
            <p>The constant <m>3</m> needs to be moved so only the exponential remains on the left side of the equation. <me>(2.83)^{x}=\frac{15}{3}</me>
            Voil&#224;! Now we have the correct form to use rule <m>\#  1</m>. Apply your favorite logarithm to both sides. I'll use <m>\ln</m> this time because I used <m>\log</m> in the last example. <me>\ln (2.83)^{x}= \ln \big( \frac{15}{3} \big)</me> The exponent comes down and we have: <me>x \ln(2.83)= \ln \big( \frac{15}{3} \big)</me>The last step is to isolate the variable <me>x= \frac{\ln \big( \frac{15}{3} \big)}{\ln(2.83)}</me> so that (rounded to three decimals): <me>x \approx 1.547</me></p>
            <p><term><em>Rule <m>\# 2</m>:</em></term> <m>\log_{b}(AB)=\log_{b}(A)+\log_{b}(B)</m></p>
            <p>In English the second rule says, <q>The log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs.</q></p>
            <p>Applying <m>\ln</m> to both sides of our equation, we in fact have the log of the product <m>3</m> times <m>(2.83)^{x}</m> on the left side <me>\ln (3(2.83)^{x})=\ln(15)</me> Use rule <m>\# 2</m> to write the left side of the equation as the sum of the logs <me>\ln(3)+\ln(2.83)^{x}=\ln(15)</me> Remember the goal is to isolate the variable <m>x</m> which we can now do since, on the left side, one term has <m>x</m> and the other does not.</p>
            <p>Subtracting <m>\ln(3)</m> from both sides we get <me>\ln (2.83)^{x}=\ln(15)-\ln(3)</me> Look, we get to use rule <m>\# 1</m> anyway! On the left we bring down the exponent, <m>x</m> <me>x \ln(2.83)=\ln(15)-\ln(3)</me> Now isolate <m>x</m> <me>x=\frac{\ln(15)-\ln(3)}{\ln(2.83)}</me> We get the same answer as before <me>x \approx 1.547</me></p>
            <p>Which method did you like better?</p>            
          </solution>
        </example>
        <exercise>
          <introduction><p>Of course we could have just solved the equation <m>3(2.83)^{x}=15</m> graphically and avoided the algebra all together.</p></introduction>
          <webwork>
            <statement>
              <p>[@MODES(HTML=&gt;'&lt;iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/Z4mRThfg/width/431/height/455/border/888888/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="431px" height="455px" style="border:0px;"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;', TeX =&gt;"A GeoGebra applet.");@]*</p>
              <p>The graph of the exponential function <m>f(x)=3(2.83)^{x}</m> will reach different heights depending on the input <m>x</m>.  What <m>x</m> value makes the graph <m>y=15</m> units high?</p>
              <p>Drag the output value to <m>y=15</m> to find the solution rounded to <m>2</m> decimal places.</p>
              <p><m>x \approx</m> <var name="1.55" width="5" /></p>
            </statement>
          </webwork>
          <conclusion>
            <p>A note about solving. In the two algebra examples we were able to find exact solutions <me>x= \frac{\ln \big( \frac{15}{3} \big)}{\ln(2.83)}</me> is exact.</p>
            <p>We then entered the exact expressions into a calculator and found approximations rounded to three decimal places. Though graphically may seem quick and easy, most often we can only get an approximation to the answer.</p>
          </conclusion>
        </exercise>
        <p>Finally, we could just ask a computer to solve the equation for us. Many websites have tools for solving equations such as: <m>3(2.83)\text{^x = 15}</m> You may wish to perform a web search for such a website.</p>
        <p>Technology can now do much of what only people could do in the past. The question is no longer <q>Can you solve an equation?</q>, the question is <q>Do you have the right equation?</q></p>
        <p>Computers can solve all kinds of equations, but so far only people have the ability to set the problems up.</p>

      <subsection>
        <title>Domain and Range</title>
        <p>Because a logarithm is just another kind of function, it has a domain and a range and the graph of a logarithmic function has its own characteristics that make it unique.</p>
        <p>We can use our language approach to understand the domain and range of a logarithmic function. Remember the literal translation of the expression <m>log(x)</m> is <q>The power of <m>10</m> that gives you <m>x</m>.</q></p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><m>log(100)</m> means <q>The power of <m>10</m> that gives you <m>100</m></q>.</p>
                  <p>So <m>log(100)=2</m> which says, <q>The power of <m>10</m> that gives you <m>100</m> is <m>2</m>.</q> Since <m>10^{2}=100</m></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><m>log_{3}(81)</m> means, <q>The power of <m>3</m> that gives you <m>81</m>.</q></p>
                  <p>So <me>log_{3}(81)=4</me> which says, <q>The power of <m>3</m> that gives you <m>81</m> is <m>4</m>.</q> Since <m>3^{4}=81</m></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </statement>
        </example>
        <p>Recall the domain of a function <m>f</m> is the set of all possible inputs the function can use (values that make sense for the function).</p>
        <p>Let <me>f(x)=log_{3}(x)</me> where <m>x</m> is the input.</p>
        <p>Consider negative input values, like <m>x=-9</m> and think about the meaning of <m>log_{3}(-9)</m></p>
        <blockquote><p><q>What power of <m>3</m> gives you <m>-9</m>?</q> </p></blockquote>
        <p>The statement makes no sense. You cannot get a negative result if all you have is positive <m>3</m>'s multiplied together. At least one has to be negative!</p>
        <p>Since any negative input leads us to the same conclusion, it turns out logarithms cannot accept negative inputs.</p>
        <p>For a similar reason logarithmic functions cannot have zero as an input. If you ask <q>How many factors of <m>3</m> does it take to get <m>0</m>?</q> or just <m>3^{?}=0</m>, it should be clear there is no answer.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the domain of any logarithmic function is all inputs that are greater than or equal to zero.</p>
        <assemblage>
          <p>Domain of <m>log_{b}(x)</m>: <m>x \gt 0</m></p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>For the range we must consider all the possible outputs we should expect from the function. In the case of the logarithm, an output is the exponent value needed to get a particular input <me>\log_{b}(\text{input})=\text{output}</me></p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>Consider <m>y=log_{3}(x)</m></p>
            <p>For any input <m>x</m> how many <m>3</m>'s does it take to get that <m>x</m> value? The answer (output) is the <m>y</m> value.</p>

        <p>The <term>vertical asymptote</term><index><main>vertical asymptote</main></index> is like a vertical boundary that the function cannot cross. In the case of the logarithm <m>y=log_{b}(x)</m> the asymptote is the <m>y</m>-axis with equation <m>x=0</m> and the function only exists to the right of this boundary.</p>
        <p>This supports our assertion that the domain of <m>y=log_{b}(x)</m> is all <m>x \gt 0</m> (to the right of the <m>y</m>-axis).</p>

        <title>Change of Base</title>
        <p>So far, when evaluating expressions like <m>\log_{3}(9)</m> it seems we need to know the answer before we evaluate. How do you evaluate an expression when you don't already know the answer?</p>
        <example>
        <statement>
          <p>Evaluate <m>\log_{3}(0.1822)</m></p>
          <p>Solution:</p>
          <p>We know the answer should be negative because we are trying to get <m>0.1822</m> which is less than <m>1</m></p>
          <p>Your calculator may already have a <q>log of any base</q> option. Today, in the <m>21</m>st century we can also find the answer, for free, on the web. For instance, go to <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1t5iqhqaad">Desmos.com</url>. Type <q><m>\log</m>{underscore key}<m>(0.1822)</m></q> into one of the cells. You should see the answer as <m>\log_{3}(0.1822) \approx -1.5498</m> and you can get more decimal places if you want.</p>
          <p>But before the web, it used to be that calculators only had one or two options for logarithms, (and before calculators there were things called "slide rules" and books with pages and pages of tables of logarithms).</p>
          <p>Here is an <q>old school</q> method of evaluating a logarithm expression. The method is called <q>change of base</q> which means you change the base from whatever it is to either base <m>10</m>, <m>\log</m>, or base <m>e</m>, <m>\ln</m>, because most calculators have those built in.</p>
          <p>Set up an equation in which <m>y</m> is the answer you want. Use the definition of the logarithm to turn the log equation into an exponential equation. Then solve the exponential equation using any base log you want. In this example we use base <m>10</m>, <m>\log</m>.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Solutions:</p>
                    <p>What is the percent hourly decay rate?</p>
                    <p>The opening sentence is telling us we must use an exponential model because the decay is a <q>constant percent</q>. The sentence goes on to tell us <em>what kind</em> of decay model and the percent rate of decay.</p>
                    <p>The word <q>continuous</q> is telling us to use base <m>e</m>. Therefore we can write the formula for decay as <me>Ae^{-kt}</me> where <m>k</m> is the continuous decay constant <m>k=<var name="$k" /></m></p>
                    <p>The value <m>A</m> represents the initial amount of substance, but it was not stated. So we put a variable there to hold its place.</p>
                    <p>The first question is about the hourly percent decay. We were given the <q>continuous</q> hourly decay. These are two different things.</p>
                    <p>A discrete model would look like <me>Ab^{t}</me> where <m>b</m> is the hourly growth factor we are trying to find. But both the discrete and continuous models have to predict the same behavior. Therefore the two formulas have to be equal <mdash /> they have to produce the same values. <me>A(b)^{t}=A(e^{-k})^t</me> Notice how the parentheses are used to show that both sides are actually the same thing. Both say <me>A(something)^{t}</me>. The <q>somethings</q> must be the same number. That is: <me>b = e^{-k}</me></p>

                    <p>What is the half-life of the substance?</p>
                    <p>The half-life is the time is takes to reduce the substance to half its value. We do not know how much substance there is, but we do know there is something.</p>
                    <p>Earlier we called the initial amount <m>A</m>. In some time we will have <m>\frac{1}{2}A</m>. How much time? The answer is the half-life.</p>

                    <p>Annual percent growth is called <q>discrete growth</q>. Not because it is annual, per se, but because it is measured at the end of some finite time interval.

                  <p>A half-life is the time it takes for the chemical to decay to half its current value. We are told the half-life is <var name="$halflifemin" /> minutes, which means every <var name="$halflifemin" /> minutes the amount of chemical is halved.</p>

                  <p>Notice we can rewrite our formula to show the <q>per</q> minute growth factor <me>C(0.5)^\frac{t}{<var name="$halflifemin" />}=C(0.5^\frac{1}{<var name="$halflifemin" />})^{t}</me> where <me>b=0.5^\frac{1}{<var name="$halflifemin" />}</me> <m>b \approx </m> <var name="$b" width="5" /> <em>(round to <m>3</m> decimal places)</em></p>

                <p>In the study of populations (population dynamics) the situation often arises where we must solve logarithmic equations.</p>
                <p>For instance, when searching for an equation to model a population that has a carrying capacity (a maximum number the population can sustain) we can end up with an equation like <me>\ln(P)-\ln(1-P)=t</me>in which the goal is to isolate <m>P</m> as a function of <m>t</m>. It is a good exercise in algebra and log rules.</p>
                <p>Use rule <m>\# 3</m> to write the left side of the equation <me>\ln(P)-\ln(1-P)=t</me> as one term.</p>

                <p>Multiply both sides of the equation <m>\frac{P}{1-P}=e^{t}</m> by <m>(1-P)</m> and distribute on the right side to get <me>P=e^{t}-Pe^{t}</me></p>
