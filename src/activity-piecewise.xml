  <title>Piecewise Defined Functions Activity </title>

  <subsection>
      <title>Evaluating Pieces of Different Functions</title>
        <p>A piecewise defined function is literally a function that has been defined in pieces.  Most likely you have encountered piecewise defined functions in every day life.  Maybe you didn't know what they were called.</p>
        <p>For instance, the cost to park downtown will have a flat fee for the first hour, then some different hourly rate for up to some max, all day fee.  To calculate the cost of parking there are various formulas, each one is a <q>piece</q> of the whole cost function.</p>
        <p>The most difficult part of piecewise functions is the notation.  In the following set of activities you will use a skill you already know, evaluate a function graphically, and transition slowly into how to write and understand piecewise notation.</p>

              <p>Use the blue input slider point on the horizontal axis to navigate across the piecewise functions graphed above.</p>
              <p>Evaluate each expression below.  Round your answers to the nearest integer and use <q>DNE</q> if there is no answer.</p>

              <p>Notice that sometimes you would use line A or Line B or Line C to evaluate the function.</p>
              <p>Which line did you use to evaluate <m>f(0)?</m> Line: <var name="$B" form="buttons" /> </p>

              <p>But just like when you used the graph to evaluate different input values, you only use the piece of the graph that corresponds to the input you were given.  It's a function afterall, so one input can only give you one output. If all you had were formulas instead of the graph, you would have to decide which formula to use depending on the input given.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind if two lines intersect at the same point then the input value is shared between the two formulas.  If two line are joined at <m>x = 21</m> for example, then <m>x = 21</m> belongs in the domain of each line.</p>
              <p>Under what conditions would you use Line A to evaluate the function?</p>
              <p>Line A if x is <var name="$answer1" width="10" /></p>
              <p>Under what conditions would you use Line B to evaluate the function?</p>
              <p>Line B if x is <var name="$answer2" width="10" /></p>

      <title>One Function Pieced Together</title>

      <p>In the previous exercise you identified the equations of three separate lines and you stated the intervals for which each line was to be used.  In fact, you stated the <term>domain</term> for each equation.  When two or more equations are put together to form one function it's called a <term>piecewise defined function</term>.  The function has to state what all the formulas are and it also has to let the reader know when to use them.  In short, the notation has to let the reader know the equations and their domains.</p>
      <p>Next we learn how to set up the notation so that a reader can easily identify each formula and it's corresponding domain.</p>

              <p>Earlier you found the equations for Lines A, B and C and the domain for each line.  In order to create one function from the three equations we still use function notation, but we group all the formulas to be used in a <q>curly</q> bracket.  After the bracket, all equations to be used are listed on a left column and the domain for each is listed in a right column as shown in the example below.</p>

    <title>Graphing a Piecewise Defined Function</title>
      <p>We can now use our understanding of piecewise noation to read piecewise functions and graph them. Remember, the domain of a function is the collection of inputs for which the function exists.  On a graph, a function is visible only for inputs in its domain and it is not visible for inputs outside its domain.</p>

                    <p>When you have plotted all graphs correctly, give yourself a point by entering a <m>1</m> in the box below.</p>

                    <p>Below we see all the pieces we graphed earlier are now shown together as one function.  It is missing the boundaries that show which end values are included and which are not.  Drag the open circle to the boundary that should show as not included.  Use the domains in the piecewise function to help make your decision.</p>
