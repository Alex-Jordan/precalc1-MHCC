      <title>Intervals</title>

      <p>An interval is a section or portion of either the vertical or horizontal axis.  We use intervals to help describe the behavior of a function.  For instance the temperature T in degrees fahrenheit throughout the day depends on the time of day t hours after midnight.  In function notation would could write</p>
      <p><me>T = f(t)</me></p>
      <p>Starting from midnight at t = 0 the temperature is typically still dropping until about 5 hours (5 <init>a.m.</init>) when it is coldest.  Then as the sun comes up, the temperature begins to increase until it hits the hotest time of the day, maybe 17 hours (5 <init>p.m.</init>). From then on the temperature begins to drop again and the cycle repeast itself.</p>
      <p>The rise and fall of the temperature during the day happens at certain intervals of time.  We observe the temperature increases for times between 5 hours and 17 hours after midnight.  In math this sentence is written like this</p>
      <blockquote>T increases for <m>5 \leqslant t \leqslant 17</m></blockquote>
      <p>Likewise, the temperature outside is decreasing for times between 0 hours and 5 hours after midnight, then again for times between 17 hours and 24 hours after midnight. In math this sentence is written like this</p>
      <blockquote>T decreases for <m>0 \leqslant t \leqslant 5</m> and <m>17 \leqslant t \leqslant 24</m></blockquote>
      <p>Notice in each case our observations about temperature T were based on the <em>input</em> <m>t</m> that give us the desired results. The ouputs have certain properties on different sections of the input axis.</p>
