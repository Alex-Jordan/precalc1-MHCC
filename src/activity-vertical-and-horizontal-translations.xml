    <title>Vertical and Horizontal Translations Activity</title>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Purpose</title>
      <p>In this activity, we will explore how to <term>transform</term> the graph of a function by making changes to its formula in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><m>f(x) + k</m></p></li>
        <li><p><m>f(x + h)</m></p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>By the end of this activity, you will be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Recognize the geometric effect of these types of transformations</p></li>
        <li><p>Write the formula for a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sketch the graph of a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>First, we will see the effect of making a change to the <em>output</em> of a function. You will be able to describe what happens to the graph of a function after it has been changed from: <md>
    <mrow>y = f(x)</mrow>
    <mrow>\text{to}</mrow>
    <mrow>y = f(x) + k</mrow></md></p>

    <p>Now, let's apply the idea of shifting a graph to a physical example in the next two exercises.</p>

    <exercise>
      <webwork xml:id="vertical-and-horizontal-transformation-application-projectile-motion">
        <setup>

          <var name="$afterT">
            <static>t-1</static>
          </var>

              <member correct="yes">\text{Graph 1}</member>
              <member>\text{Graph 2}</member>
            </set>

              <member>\text{?}</member>
              <member correct="yes">\text{Input}</member>
              <member>\text{Output}</member>
            </set>
          </var>

          <pg-code>
            Context('Numeric');
            Context()->variables->are(t=>'Real');
            $afterT=Formula("t-1");
            $whichGraph=PopUp(
              ["?","Graph 1", "Graph 2"], "Graph 1"
            );
            $inOut=PopUp(
              ["?","Input","Output"],"Input"
            );
          </pg-code>

        </setup>

        <statement>
          <p>The function <m>h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 10t + 40</m> will approximate the height of an object which was thrown straight upward at a speed of 10 meters per second at time <m>t = 0</m> seconds from a height of 40 meters. See the graph below.</p>
          <p>You can move the point to see how high the object will be at a certain time, or when the object will hit the ground.</p>
          <p>[@MODES(HTML=&gt;'&lt;iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/BmHTxqW6/width/421/height/260/border/888888/sri/true" width="421px" height="260px" style="border:0px;"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;', TeX =&gt;"A GeoGebra applet.");@]*</p>
          <p>Now, we can use this function to describe other situations involving such an object. For example, suppose the person had waited until <m>t = 1</m> second before throwing the object.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Which graph below shows the height of the object if the person waited 1 second before throwing it?</p>
            <p>Graph 1 [@MODES(HTML=&gt;'&lt;iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/kCE4de8p/width/421/height/260/border/888888/sri/true" width="421px" height="260px" style="border:0px;"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;', TeX =&gt;"A GeoGebra applet.");@]*</p>

            <p>Answer:  <var name="$whichGraph" form="popup" /></p></li>
            <li><p>Since this is a <em>horizontal</em> translation of the original graph <m>h(t)</m>, are we changing the <em>input</em> or the <em>output</em>?</p>
            <p><var name="$inOut" form="popup" /></p></li>
            <li><p>In order to correctly shift the graph of <m>h(t)</m>, what will we use for the <em>input</em> in the formula for the function <m>h</m>? Type your expression below.</p>
            <p><var name="$afterT" width="10" /></p></li>
          </ol>
        </statement>
        <hint><p>For the input which will correctly shift the graph, recall that adding a positive number to <m>t</m> will move the graph to the left, and subtracting a positive number from <m>t</m> will move the graph to the right.</p></hint>
        <solution><p>The correct graph is the one beginning at the point <m>(1,40)</m>. This is a horizontal shift to the right by <m>1</m> second, so the input must be changed from <m>t</m> to <m>t-1</m>.</p></solution>

      </webwork>

    </exercise>

    <p>Let's build on the previous exercise by using both vertical <em>and</em> horizontal translations.</p>

    <exercise>
      <webwork xml:id="vertical-and-horizontal-transformations-application-projectile-motion-time-delay-and-hight-increase">
        <setup>
          <var name="$input">
            <static>t-3</static>
          </var>

          <var name="$addOrSubtract">
            <set>
              <member correct="yes">\text{add}</member>
              <member>\text{subtract}</member>
            </set>
          </var>

          <var name="$outputChange">
            <static>12</static>
          </var>

          <pg-code>
            Context()->variables->are(t=>'Real');
            $input=Compute("t-3");
            $addOrSubtract=PopUp(["?","add","subtract"],"add");
            $outputChange=Real(12);

          </pg-code>

        </setup>

        <statement>

          <p>Again, the function <m>f(t) = -4.9t^2 + 10t + 40</m> represents the height of an object which was thrown straight upward at a speed of 10 meters per second, from an initial height of 40 meters.</p>
          <p>Suppose now that the person waited <m>3</m> seconds and also carried it an additional 12 meters higher in elevation before throwing it.</p>
          <p>Waiting 3 seconds is a change to the input <m>t</m>, so the input of the function will now be: <var name="$input" width="5" /></p>
          <p>Carrying the object an additional 12 meters upward before throwing it is a change to the output, so we will <var name="$addOrSubtract" form="popup" /> the number <m>12</m> to the outside of the function.</p>
          <p>Putting these transformations together, the formula will now be:</p>
          <p><m>f(</m><var name="$input" width="5" /><m>) + </m><var name="$outputChange" width="2" /></p>
          <p>= <m>-4.9(</m><var name="$input" width="5" /><m>)^2 + 10(</m><var name="$input" width="5" /><m>) + 40 + </m><var name="$outputChange" width="2" /></p>

        </statement>
      </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <p>Finally, we'll see an application of using vertical and horizontal <term>translations</term> to quickly perform a familiar task: Finding the equation of a line</p>

    <example>
      <p>The linear function <me>f(x) = 4x</me> will graph as a line with slope <m>4</m>, passing through the origin <m>(0,0)</m>.</p>
      <p>Now, using translations, it would be easy to write the equations of similar lines.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p>The line with slope <m>4</m>, passing through the point <m>(3,5)</m>, may be thought of as the result of shifting <m>f(x)</m> to the <em>right</em> by <m>3</m> units, and <em>up</em> by <m>5</m> units.</p>
      <p>[In this case, we are focusing our attention on moving the old point <m>(0,0)</m> to the new point <m>(3,5)</m>.]</p>
      <p>What would be the equation of this new line?</p>

      <hint>
        <p>Since <m>f(x)</m> has the point <m>(0,0)</m>, think about shifting that point to <m>(3,5)</m>. Begin by shifting the function to the right by <m>3</m> units, so the input will be <m>x-3</m>.</p>
        <p>Next, apply the translation which moves the graph up by <m>5</m> units.</p>
      </hint>
      <answer><p>Without doing any simplification to the formula, the line would be: <md>
        <mrow>y \amp= f(x-3) + 5</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp= 4(x-3) + 5</mrow></md></p>
      </answer>
    </example>

        <statement>
          <p>The equation of a line with slope <m>m</m>, passing through the origin, is just: <me>y = mx</me></p>
          <p>If we wanted to change this line so it had the same slope but passed through the point <m>(a,b)</m>, what would be the equation?</p>
          <p>Answer:  <var name="$equation" form="popup" /></p>
          <p>This is a very useful formula for writing the equation of a line if you know the slope and any single point on its graph. This formula is called the <term>Point-Slope</term> formula for a line.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>The equation is <me>y = m(x-a) + b</me> no matter the sign (+ or -) on the values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</p>
        </solution>
