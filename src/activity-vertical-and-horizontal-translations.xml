    <title>Vertical and Horizontal Translations Activity</title>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Purpose</title>
      <p>In this activity, we will explore how to <term>transform</term> the graph of a function by making changes to its formula in the following ways:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li><p><m>f(x) + k</m></p></li>
        <li><p><m>f(x + h)</m></p></li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>By the end of this activity, you will be able to:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li><p>Recognize the geometric effect of these types of transformations</p></li>
        <li><p>Write the formula for a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sketch the graph of a basic function which has been changed by these transformations.</p></li>
      </ul></p>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>First, we will see the effect of making a change to the <em>output</em> of a function. You will be able to describe what happens to the graph of a function after it has been changed from: <md>
      <mrow>y = f(x)</mrow>
      <mrow>\text{to}</mrow>
      <mrow>y = f(x) + k</mrow></md></p>

          <p>The function <m>h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 10t + 40</m> will approximate the height of an object which was thrown straight upward at a speed of 10 meters per second at time <m>t = 0</m> seconds from a height of 40 meters. See the graph below.</p>
          <p>You can move the point to see how high the object will be at a certain time, or when the object will hit the ground.</p>

        <solution><p>The correct graph is the one beginning at the point <m>(1,40)</m>. This is a horizontal shift to the right by <m>1</m> second, so the input must be changed from <m>t</m> to <m>t-1</m>.</p></solution>

      </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <p>Let's build on the previous exercise by using both vertical <em>and</em> horizontal translations.</p>

    <exercise>
      <webwork xml:id="vertical-and-horizontal-transformations-application-projectile-motion-time-delay-and-hight-increase">
        <setup>
          <var name="$input">
            <static>t-3</static>
          </var>

          <var name="$addOrSubtract">
            <set>
              <member correct="yes">\text{add}</member>
              <member>\text{subtract}</member>
            </set>
          </var>

          <var name="$outputChange">
            <static>12</static>
          </var>

          <pg-code>
            Context()->variables->are(t=>'Real');
            $input=Compute("t-3");
            $addOrSubtract=PopUp(["?","add","subtract"],"add");
            $outputChange=Real(12);
          </pg-code>

        </setup>

        <statement>
          <p>Again, the function <m>f(t) = -4.9t^2 + 10t + 40</m> represents the height of an object which was thrown straight upward at a speed of 10 meters per second, from an initial height of 40 meters.</p>
          <p>Suppose now that the person waited <m>3</m> seconds and also carried it an additional 12 meters higher in elevation before throwing it.</p>
          <p>Waiting 3 seconds is a change to the input <m>t</m>, so the input of the function will now be: <var name="$input" width="5" /></p>
          <p>Carrying the object an additional 12 meters upward before throwing it is a change to the output, so we will <var name="$addOrSubtract" form="popup" /> the number <m>12</m> to the outside of the function.</p>
          <p>Putting these transformations together, the formula will now be:</p>
          <p><m>f\big(</m><var name="$input" width="5" /><m>\big) + </m><var name="$outputChange" width="2" /></p>
          <p>= <m>-4.9\big(</m><var name="$input" width="5" /><m>\big)^2 + 10\big(</m><var name="$input" width="5" /><m>\big) + 40 + </m><var name="$outputChange" width="2" /></p>

        </statement>
      </webwork>
    </exercise>

    <p>Finally, we'll see an application of using vertical and horizontal <term>translations</term> to quickly perform a familiar task: Finding the equation of a line</p>

          <p>The linear function <me>f(x) = 4x</me> will graph as a line with slope <m>4</m>, passing through the origin <m>(0,0)</m>.</p>
          <p>Now, using translations, it would be easy to write the equations of similar lines.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <p>The line with slope <m>4</m>, passing through the point <m>(7,15)</m>, may be thought of as the result of shifting <m>f(x)</m> to the <em>right</em> by <m>7</m> units, and <em>up</em> by <m>15</m> units.</p>
          <p>[In this case, we are focusing our attention on moving the old point <m>(0,0)</m> to the new point <m>(7,15)</m>.]</p>
          <p>What would be the equation of this new line?</p>
          <p>Answer:  <var name="$formulas" form="popup" /></p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>Since <m>f(x)</m> has the point <m>(0,0)</m>, think about shifting that point to <m>(7,15)</m>. Remember that adding to the <em>input</em> will move the graph to the left, and subtracting from the input will move the graph to the right.</p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>Without doing any simplification to the formula, the line would be: <md>
            <mrow>y \amp= f(x-7) + 15</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= 4(x-7) + 15</mrow></md></p>

          <p>The line with slope <m>11</m>, passing through the origin <m>(0,0)</m>, has the equation: <me>f(x) = 11x</me></p>
          <p>Using translations, write the equation for the line with slope <m>11</m>, passing through the point <m>(<var name="$a[0]" />,-<var name="$a[1]" />)</m>.</p>
          <p>Answer:  <m>y = </m><var name="$whichLine" width="15" /></p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Think of moving the point <m>(0,0)</m> to the point <m>(<var name="$a[0]" />,-<var name="$a[1]" />)</m>.</p>
          <p>We would shift the graph to the right by <var name="$a[0]" /> units and down by <var name="$a[1]" /> units, and the equation would be: <m>y = 11(x - <var name="$a[0]" />) - <var name="$a[1]" /></m></p>

          <p>The equation of a line with slope <m>m</m>, passing through the origin, is just: <me>y = mx</me></p>
          <p>If we wanted to change this line so it had the same slope but passed through the point <m>(a,b)</m>, what would be the equation?</p>
          <p>Answer:  <var name="$equation" form="popup" /></p>
          <p>This is a very useful formula for writing the equation of a line if you know the slope and any single point on its graph. This formula is called the <term>Point-Slope</term> formula for a line.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>The equation is <me>y = m(x-a) + b</me> no matter the sign (+ or -) on the values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</p>
