  <title>Introduction to Exponential Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>You may have heard, <q>The world is constantly changing</q>.  But the big question is <q>How?</q> Is there a pattern?  In math patterns have names.</p>
    <p><term>Linear</term> is the name of a pattern.  If you graph a linear formula, it looks like a straight line.  If you look at the data of a linear pattern you will notice the data has a constant <term>rate of change</term> in other words constant slope.</p>
    <p>In this section we study a pattern in which something else remains constant, but it's not the rate of change, it is the percent.</p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Review of Percent Change</title>
    <p>A <term>percent change</term> on a value means to change it by a fraction of itself.  When someone gets a <m>10 \%</m> raise in salary it means that their salary was divided into pieces <me>\frac{\displaystyle{10}}{\displaystyle{100}} = \frac{\displaystyle{1}}{\displaystyle{10}}</me> and one of those pieces was added onto their original salary.  Think of it like this</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>New Salary = Old Salary + <m>1/10</m> of Old Salary</p>
        <p>New Salary = Old Salary + <m>0.10</m> of Old Salary</p>
    </blockquote>
        <p>If we let <m>N</m> represent the new salary and <m>s</m> represent the old salary we can write</p>
        <md>
            <mrow>N \amp= s + 0.1s</mrow>
        </md>
    <p>Notice when we look at the statement as an equation, the variable <m>s</m> is factor of both terms on the right.  Therefore <m>s</m> can be factored out and the equation can be rewritten as</p>
        <md>
            <mrow>N \amp= (1 + 0.1)s</mrow>
            <mrow>N \amp= 1.1s</mrow>
        </md>
    <p>We are now able to think of a <m>10 \%</m> increase as a multiple of <m>1.1</m>  where the <m>1</m> represents the <m>100 \%</m> you already had and the <m>0.1</m> represents the <m>10 \%</m> increase.</p>
    <p>In the equation <m>N = 1.1s</m> the number <m>1.1</m> is called the <term>growth factor</term> and is usually denoted with letter <m>b</m>.</p>
    <p>In this example multiplying s by growth factor of 1.1 makes s bigger by <m>10 \%</m></p>
    <p>Whenever a percent value is given we must turn that value into its <term>decimal equivlent</term> so we can use it.  The value <m>10 \%</m> has a decimal equivalent of <m>\frac{\displaystyle{10}}{\displaystyle{100}} = 0.1</m>.</p>
    <p>In fact, the decimal equivalent of any percent value is that value divided by 100.</p>
    <me>
        r = \frac{\displaystyle{\text{Pecent Value}}}{\displaystyle{100}}
    </me>
    <p>A percent increase means to multiply the original value by <m>b = 1 + r</m> where <m>r</m> is the decimal equivalent of the given percent.</p>
    <p>In our salary example <m>r = 0.1</m> so we multiplied by <m>b = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1</m> to get the <m>10 \%</m> increase.</p>
    
    <p>In general, for exponential growth the <term>growth factor</term> is defined as</p>
    <me>b = 1 + r</me>
    <p>Notice that the growth factor is greater than 1 for exponential growth.</p>

                    <p>Price of milk last year at a local grocery store was <m>\$</m>3.43 per gallon.  Today the price of milk is higher by <m>7.5 \%</m>, what is the price of milk today? Round your answer to the nearest penny.</p>
                    <p>Here's how:</p>
                    <p>In order to get a percent increase on the price of milk we must multiply by a growth factor greater than one.  In math we say, <m>b \gt 1</m>.</p>
                    <p>What is the growth factor for a <m>7.5 \%</m> increase?</p>
                    <p><m>b = </m> <var name="$b1" width="5" /></p>
                    <p>We multiply our growth factor by the original price of milk to get the new price of the milk.</p>
                    <p>The price of milk today is <m>\$</m><var name="$increase1" width="5" />.</p>
                    <p>The value of a stock was at <m>\$ 21.32</m> per share yesterday. Today that same stock is valued at <m>\$ 24.07</m> per share. What is the percent increase in the value of the stock? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.</p>
                    <p>We know the value of the stock has increaseed, therefore we must have multiplied by a number <m>b \gt 1</m>.  We need to find <m>b</m> and we can use what we know about the beginning and ending stock values to find it.</p>
                    <p><m>21.32 * b = 24.07</m> Now solve for <m>b</m></p>
                    <p><m>b = </m> <var name="$b2" width="5" /></p>
                    <p>We can get the percent increase from the growth factor since <m>b = 1 + r</m>. Find <m>r</m> and turn it into a percent</p>
                    <p>The stock value increase by <var name="$increase2" width="5" /> <m>\%</m>.</p>
                </statement>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>
    <p>Just like something can increase by a percent, it is possible to decrease by a percent.</p>
    <p>Consider a pair of shorts on sale where the original price of the shorts has been reduced by 15%.  This means the price of the shorts is divided into pieces and one of those pieces is subtracted from the original price of the shorts.</p>
    <p>To reduce the price by <m>15 \%</m> we must turn the percent value into its decimal equivalent.  The decimal equivalent of <m>15 \%</m> is <m>\frac{\displaystyle{15}}{\displaystyle{100}} = 0.15</m>.</p>
    <p>Therefore the sale price of the shorts is</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>New Price = Old Price <m>-</m> <m>0.15</m> * Old Price</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If we let <m>N</m> represent the new price and <m>p</m> represent the old price we can write</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>N \amp= p - 0.15p</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Again, notice that <m>p</m> is a common factor in both terms on the right, so we can write</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>N \amp= (1 - 0.15)p</mrow>
        <mrow>N \amp= 0.85p</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Look at what we end up with.  A <m>15 \%</m> reduction in price means to multiply the original price by <m>0.85</m>. This is the growth factor again.  However, in this calculation we observe the price we actually pay, that is <m>85 \%</m> of the original price.  We have to think a little bit to realize the decrease is <m>100 \% - 85 \% = 15 \%</m></p>
    <p>A percent decrease means to multiply the original value by <m>b = 1 - r</m> where <m>r</m> is the decimal equivalent of the given percent. Notice that a decrease by a percent means to multiply by a number less than 1. In math we say <m>b \lt 1</m></p>
    <p>Consider a study on the reduction of asthma.</p>

    <p>Something to consider about a percent decrease is, <q>How much can we decrease?</q> Let's think about that for a moment.</p>
    <p>If you have 10 apples, you can eat <m>50 \%</m> of them, that's half the apples.  You can eat <m>75 \%</m> of them, that's <m>7 \frac{1}{2}</m> apples.  You can even eat all the apples, that's <m>100 \%</m> of the apples!</p>
    <p>But, can you eat more than all the apples you have?  If you only have <m>10</m> apples, you cannot eat more than <m>10</m> apples, you cannot decrease by more than <m>100 \%</m> of what you have.</p>
    <p>Therefore when it comes to a percent loss, the growth factor is less than <m>1</m> for sure, but it cannot be less than <m>0</m>. Furthermore, since muliplying by zero is zero, it makes the <q>growth</q> very uninetesting.  From now on a growth factor is always strictly greater than zero.  The only choices are to be greater than <m>1</m> or between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m></p>
    <p>In math we say percent growth means <m>b \gt 1</m> and percent decay is <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m></p>

    <title>Constant Percent Change</title>
    <p>We now know in order to change a value by a percent, we need to multiply.</p>
    <p>If we multiply by a factor between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> we get a percent decrease while if we multiply by a factor greater than 1 we get a percent increase.</p>
    <p>By the way, what happens when you multiply by a factor of <m>1</m>? [Hint: nothing which is also uninteresting, so we don't include it as a possible growth factor.]</p>

                    <p>At the end of the 10 year period the value of the stock has been compounded 10 times. What is the overall growth factor after 10 years? <var name="$bOverAll" width="5" /> (round your answer to 4 decimal places)</p>

                    <p>What percent increase does this overall growth factor represent? <var name="$rOverAll" width="5" /><m>\%</m> (round your answer to <m>2</m> decimal places)</p>
                    <p>This has been another example of how consecutive percent increases translate into repeated multiplication. We end up with exponents where the exponents <q>count</q> how many times the growth factor has been used.</p>
                    <p>Since our investment is compounded for 10 years, we end up with a growth factor multiplied by itself 10 times, as in</p>
                    <me>b^{10} = <var name="$b" />^{10} = <var name="$bOverAll" /></me>

        <p>At this moment the word <q>countable</q> may seem strange.  It means, <q>A quantity you can count or put on a number line</q>, like <m>12</m> or <m>205</m> or
         or <m>50,235,678</m>
         or even <m>3</m> billion.</p>
         <p>You must be wondering, <q>What's not countable?</q> Well, how about infinity?  Infinity is not countable. You cannot count to infinity and it's not something you can put on a number line. We'll talk more about infinite compounding later.</p>

    <title>Exponential Formulas</title>
        <p>Just like linear formulas have a particular <q>shape</q> or format like <m>y = mx + b</m>, for instance, so do exponential formulas. In this next part of the activity we will use a table of values to see patterns that emerge from constant percent growth or decay.</p>
        <p>To find a pattern within numerical data, it is best to record how we get our results instead of the results themselves.</p>

                    <p>So our growth factor <m>b</m> is compounded 5 times, once for each hour between <m>t = 3</m> and <m>t = 8</m>.</p>

                    <p>Which we use to solve for the hourly growth factor.</p>
                    <me>b^{5} = \frac{\displaystyle{<var name="$finalTemp" />}}{\displaystyle{<var name="$a" />}}</me>

                        <mrow><var name="$finalTemp" /> \amp= a(<var name="$bRoot" />)^8</mrow>
                        <mrow>a \amp= <var name="$initialTemp" /></mrow>
                    </md>
                    <p>So the final formula is <m>f(t) = <var name="$initialTemp" />(<var name="$bRoot" />)^t</m></p>
